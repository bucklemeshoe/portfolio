          "text": "How we broke an e-commerce giant!April 29, 2019We took a price aggregator with an awesome built in product and price comparison tool, made it responsive (the task) but at the same time stripped it of everything engaging. I\u2019ll tell you how and what happened next.We were a UX team of 10 - made up of Interaction Designers (I was one), front-end developers, a UX researcher, 2 BA\u2019s, our UX team lead (also head of product) and we even had a product advisor! We were also backed by a big squad of back end devs, a R&D team constantly working on improving search and 30 other people doing all sorts.Why did I take the time to introduce you to the team? Because it\u2019s important you know how many people were impacted by our bad UX decisions.To make sure no-one is hurt or takes complete offence by anything that is said here, even though I believe this is the truest account of what happened - I will call the companyE-comRetailer XLets start here, what wasE-com Retailer X?E-com Retailer Xwas once a leading South African price aggregator and at the time had such an impressive SEO footprint that you could just about search for any product for sale online on any of the most popular search engines and you\u2019d findE-com Retailer Xlisting of that product in the top 3 results. This site used to PUMP!This is almost exactly whatE-com Retailer Xlooked like when I joined:\u00a0This is Takealot.com - South Africas no.1 online superstore!View fullsizeTakealot.com - South Africas no.1 online superstoreThings they got right:Exposed categories with nested sub-cats;Prominent search;Highlighted Daily Deals which get sent to account holders inboxes daily (great deals here guys!);Brand search;Tabs, all in all not hiding much behind navigation;Ad space used to highlight new products, sales and seasonal best buys;Tiles displaying popular products/sections of the day, week or month, I think this is randomised (even better!);The use of a few UI tricks like whitespace, moving products on a carousel and large open sub categories make it really easy to navigate around this page.I cant be 100% certain of everything, but I do rememberE-com Retailer Xlooking almost exactly like this when I started. So if it works now, why did it not work then? We\u2019re all aware that trends, usage patterns and people especially change overtime. But I\u2019ll explain why I think us changing from this simple, effective UX was the beginning of the end for this online giant.OK, so the site had an amazing SEO footprint - Cool story bro, what was so special about thisE-com Retailer X?Let\u2019s diveLet\u2019s look at the 4 different models for e-commerce retailers:Free advertising (paid for ad ons) |gumtree.co.zaSell their own products and handle fulfilment |takealot.comSell other peoples things and take a cut when user buys (they handle fulfilment) |bidorbuy.co.zaAggregate products from all suppliers and link users to the suppliers sites for purchase and fulfilment |E-com Retailer XBesides amazing SEO bringing organic traffic to a site that could show aggregated products, ranges of models and colours, then differentiating then finally by price, there was another trick up their online sleeve.Price ComparisonYou could look at up to 3 products side-by-side and compare them across a range of criteria. Ever seen GSMArena?Like this\ufeffWhy am I writing this case study and why am I so passionate about it?Firstly, I am passionate about everything I write/speak about. But, I also really believed in the product, the product vision and loved the working environment and admired my colleagues.How the perfect eco-system workedUsers would search the internet for a product they wanted to purchase - let\u2019s say they wanted an iPhone XS. They would open a browser and on their fav search engine run a search for\u00a0 \u201ciPhone XS for sale Cape Town\u201d.9 out of 10 timesE-com Retailer Xwould come up as a paid search and then also the top 3 results for this search.A user could click on the link and be taken to the product page where they would be able to discover much more about the iPhone XS.Detailed descriptions and more info:Color (Black, White, Rose gold)Capacity (64, 128, 256GB)What\u2019s in the boxDifferent angles if you hadn\u2019t seen it beforeWatch an expert review the productRead user reviews from people who have recently purchased itCompare it side-by-side to the iPhone XS Max and the Samsung Galaxy S10Find the online supplier with the best priceOnce our common user had spent enough time browsing around on the site they\u2019d finally choose their preferred price and supplier and then, knowing enough about the product, complete the purchase on the supplier\u2019s side.Every time a user clicked through fromE-com Retailer Xto the suppliers online store, that supplier would payE-com Retailer Xa click through fee. And that is how we made the big bucks!Most importantThe most important pieces of the puzzle that created the ecosystem and kept it working, were:Great SEO effortsGreat email and online marketing effortsGreat support teamAccessibility across almost any cellphone from the dumbest to the smartest and everything in between (Remember Blackberrys)Cross platform integrations (WeChat, SMS, MTN)Very stable product with solid dev team backing itThe TaskMakeE-com Retailer XresponsiveReachAt that time we had people using SMS to search for products, and using 3rd party chat platforms, users could run a search and in almost chat-bot like style receive results and click out to complete discovery. We had deals with major network service providers preloading the app on flagship devices in and outside of South Africa.ProblemOur reach was far and our team was big, but having a range of different applications across multiple stores with multiple code bases became a nightmare to manage and even scarier to test (I was testing on 24 devices at one point). \u00a0In order to keep ahead of the times, it was decided that ONE RESPONSIVE SITE TO RULE THEM ALL was the answer.Over the period of a year, we madeE-com Retailer Xresponsive. Through a combined team effort - which included late night work sessions multiple times per week, sprints of varying lengths and feedback rich retrospectives lead, attended and facilitated by our expert team. But, never without the energy shifting interruption of miss management, lack of communication, bad planning and no understanding of who we built it for - we did it!View fullsizeOld screenshot of a mockup created at the timeWhere we went wrongWe focused solely on the new product we were building and barely took into account flows that were already working for users, and oh, making money for us;We laughed at the SEO guy when he tried tosqueezein a ticket or two for the dev team to ensure the new platform was as SEO\u2019d (sorry) as the current one was;We lost sight of the core and built new features to bring extra revenue streams that were so far off the business model that it sometimes seemed we were trying to makemoney for jam.We did not understand enough about our users and how they used our site and what kept them coming back;We flipped the switch on old users with no real instruction or guidance on how to use this newly launched platform (Beta may as well have been Alpha);We stripped all the information scent from the product and now pushed up above the fold a new untested feature we believed was ground breaking, that we would later find out was nothing at all;We focused our time and energy on making it as lean as possible with some flows feeling almost useless;We tampered with the only real sticky part of the site, (product discovery), and in doing so weremovedeverything that would keep users engaged.Removing every-engaging-thingExposed categories -information scent;Trending products -social validation, group identity;Side-by-side comparison -autonomy, trust, choice;Multiple images and colours -trust;Ability to zoom -trust;User reviews -group identity, social validation;Expert reviews -trust;Video product review -trust, dopamine;Deep descriptions -trust, progressive disclosure;Ratings -social validation;Too much whitespace (almost empty) -trust;The product broke the businessIt was more important that the CTA beredderandBIGGERso that users would get through the experience in record time to click it. This lightening fast transaction was great for the numbers, we increased our clicks to suppliers websites 5 fold but massively decreased conversion on their end. Users were no longer discovering the products they wanted to buy onE-com Retailer X. They could now only check the price, and then would have to click and view multiple suppliers online stores to get the overall idea of the product. It wasn\u2019t long before suppliers could smell a rat and when our monthly revenues became so high, (them spending money) and conversions month-on-month plummeted for them, we had messed with the most important part of the business - the model!This time, the product failed us. One of the biggest suppliers at the time, cancelled their contract and withdraw a few hundred-thousand product matches.That was one of the best working experiences of my life so far. The team, the vibe, the commitment to build something amazing under immense amounts of pressure and the resilience to stick it out as a team even when we fought management on ideas - which posed threats - the feeling of progress and success remained. Getting lunch with my friends or playing ping pong against temporary foes - this was a great group of people who all just so happened to work under the same roof, toward the same goal. To them I will be forever grateful, for even though we failed, we failed together and we learned much more through that experience than any textbook could teach.Closing notesTwo months after I resigned and left the company, around 20 people/friends were retrenched and asked to leave at a minute\u2019s notice.- Theteambroke the product;- Theproductbroke the business;- Thebusinessbroke the team.The company, since then, seems to be doing much better and I wish them nothing but success as they continue their journey.Thanks for readingBe kind.

style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It was more important that the CTA be <strong>redder</strong> and <strong>BIGGER</strong> so that users would get through the experience in record time to click it. This lightening fast transaction was great for the numbers, we increased our clicks to suppliers websites 5 fold but massively decreased conversion on their end. Users were no longer discovering the products they wanted to buy on <strong>E-com Retailer X</strong>. They could now only check the price, and then would have to click and view multiple suppliers online stores to get the overall idea of the product. It wasn\u2019t long before suppliers could smell a rat and when our monthly revenues became so high, (them spending money) and conversions month-on-month plummeted for them, we had messed with the most important part of the business - the model!\u00a0</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This time, the product failed us.

The team, the vibe, the commitment to build something amazing under immense amounts of pressure and the resilience to stick it out as a team even when we fought management on ideas - which posed threats - the feeling of progress and success remained. Getting lunch with my friends or playing ping pong against temporary foes - this was a great group of people who all just so happened to work under the same roof, toward the same goal. To them I will be forever grateful, for even though we failed, we failed together and we learned much more through that experience than any textbook could teach.\u00a0</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Closing notes</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Two months after I resigned and left the company, around 20 people/friends were retrenched and asked to leave at a minute\u2019s notice.\u00a0</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> - The <strong>team</strong> broke the product;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> - The <strong>product</strong> broke the business;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> - The <strong>business</strong> broke the team.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The company, since then, seems to be doing much better and I wish them nothing but success as they continue their journey.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thanks for reading<br/>Be kind.

(see Part 1 - the problem) We\u2019d build a platform that wouldn\u2019t hurt the merchants pocket or reputation, but would actually create an environment where they could start to build/rebuild brand recognition and then later reward customers for their loyalty. And for the customers well, we\u2019d give them deals they actually wanted, when they wanted it, wherever they were.Highlights:We spoke to 30 plus of Groupons subscribers (mostly family and friends, and a couple of strangers)I spoke to the man who brought Groupon to South Africa, Neal GandhiWe raised the startup capital ourselves with loans from family and friendsWe designed and developed a Blackberry App in 2011We partnered with a business advisor from the UKOver Skype we pitched a Lord from Scotland for fundingWe spoke to some of the top minds in marketing and business strategy from well-known and respected advertising agencies locally and abroadWe took to the streets to test the our MVP with merchantsStanding in front of potential business people with an iPad and a 1min 30second video (awkward)We nearly got investmentWe spent money too early as we dreamed of making so much moreThe market wasn\u2019t ready for a location based deal finding app thenWe builta location based, deal finding smartphone application- this is mouthful and always needs to be elaborated. We did try making it easier to digest, and while there wasn\u2019t anything exactly like it in the market to compare it to, we would sometimes just go with \u201cA better version of Groupon\u201d.Let\u2019s break it down:Location based- Wherever you areDeal finding- It looks for deals, based on your interest (which you\u2019ve specified)Smartphone application- In 2011 we needed to mention thisIn 2011 Blackberry was still very much a thing, so we chose to build the app for the Blackberry App Store first. We enlisted the help of a development team from India, the same team we used for bigger projects at Scream Media.We wanted to hitcmd+r(refresh) on this cesspool the deal buying economy had created - \u201cGood, clean business\u201d is what we coined it as.Merchants could offer deals they were comfortable offering, starting at 25% off (as a minimum, because is it a deal otherwise?) and they could even offer current specials like Calcacchios Twos\u2019day special where you buy one, get one. They would have full control of the deals they posted, the margins they set and the validity of these deals.For users of the app they could select the types of deals they were interested in and opt-in to receive push notifications in time to receive these deals.Example:Candy could be driving home through the CBD after a long day at the office, when suddenly her phone pings her \u201cPiiingggg!\u201d and a push notification shows that if she heads to La Perla right now, she can enjoy a free pink drink and with her feet dipped into the little pool she can enjoy the beautiful Cape Town sunset.And just as easy as it would be for the merchant to create the deal and push it live, it would be as easy for the customer to redeem the deal. All they\u2019d need to do was show the deal on their smartphone to the waitress of the restaurant, the therapist at the spa or receptionist at the hotel.How did we plan to keep track of how many deals were redeemed from the app?Well, can a restaurant keep track of how many of its customers saw their ad on a billboard along the high way?Nope.Reminder of the Groupon model:Continuing with the Candy\u2019s example, Pink DrinkNormal price: R86Groupon suggested price: R43Groupon commission: 75% (R32,25) paid when Candy buys the dealYour payout: 25% (R10,75) when Candy redeems the dealBecause the above would no longer be the case, they could afford to have every person in the restaurant use the deal and still have it be profitable for them.They would keep the same level of service offered on Twosdays at Calcacchio and the customers\u00a0would be as happy as Larry. Would it create a new stream of brand loyal customers? Maybe - maybe not, but the rest of the work would be up to them and, for a flat monthly fee, we would provide the platform for them to make it happen.Neal Gandhi said\u201cIt\u2019s a better business, but Groupon will make more money\u201d. This was in response to us pitching him, to get a feel for where we fit into this industry.Side note:We did implement a QR code for the customers, that was scannable by the merchant from inside the app. We even created a prototype for a way-to-pay that would allow customers to scan a merchants QR code to pay for their deal with a wallet on their phones. This was 2 years beforeScapScanwould launch in 2013 as a fully-fledged QR code powered payment system. Nicely done!Via LinkedIn we somehow managed to hook up with an early stage startup advisor from the UK, who did his best to help us sharpen our pitch and who even toyed with the idea of putting some of his own money into this.Which came first, the chicken or the egg?We needed users to get merchants on board, but we also needed merchants to get the users interested.We ran competitions on our Facebook page, where we would offer cash vouchers (of the type of merchants we hoped to attract) to potential customers. All this to start building an audience.We took to the streets, with a team primarily made up of students, wearing Do-A-Deali branded t-shirts and a few with iPads (armed with our kickass explainer video) to validate our business.Through pure luck, we managed to get a meeting with Michael Abel and Zeyaad Davids (now head of marketing for Virgin Active South Africa) of M&C Saatchi Abel. In doing my due diligence I found an article Michael wrote on challenger brands.\u201cA Challenger Brand as I apply the term, and having studiously avoided looking for formal definitions, is a brand or business that wishes to aggressively occupy the territory or market currently held by established others, usually through a differentiated offering and/or approach.\u201d- Michael AbelIn closing our first meeting I muttered \u201cAre we the Challenger Brand?\u201d, hoping to score  some brownie points for having done my research before the meeting. Michael replied\u201cNo, you\u2019re innovators\u201d. That was way more than I needed to feel like we\u2019d happened upon something really great! Time for celebratory beers! This while we started to spend (in our minds) the money we had not yet made on cars we could never afford and places we\u2019d only dream of going once the millions started to pour. Oh little light of mine\u2026One day after covering most of Long Street\u2019s businesses,we reached the following consensus:We would need to get users onto the platform to draw the merchants in. I was fortunate enough to sit with the owner of an already popular bar & restaurant in an always busy section of Long Street. During our chat he outlined what it really cost their business to be on platforms like Groupon, and that even though most times the margins they made were lower and the customers were not always repeat ones, they did still bring in a lot of foot traffic. But, and he said this would probably be true for many other businesses on the strip, if we had a bunch of users on the platform to start, there would be no reason for them not to run a trial with us.We packed up the team and went back to our home office to share notes.Do A Deali - Part 3 (the conclusion) coming soonTags:business,startup,app",

About 6 months in my boss and I thought of a great idea and before we knew it our relationship changed from employee - employer, to business partners.Ok that sounds like we did it in an afternoon, it took a smidge longer than that, but it really was quick and that was the beginning of a new journey for both of us, together and as individuals.Completely unrelated to the company I was working for, and he was running, we spent loads of time with our heads in the clouds. We dreamed of solutions to problems using technology we interacted with on a daily basis. Most of the time we\u2019d do this after we\u2019d had a few beers and at the end laugh it off or put it in the ice-box (I wonder how many ideas are in this ice-box everyone puts things into). This time however, we felt like we landed on something worthy of pursuing and before we knew it, we were building a business.At the time in South Africa, Groupon was the best thing since sliced bread. This was mostly because of their marketing of unbelievable deals that any sane person could not pass on. Having deals sent directly to your inbox every morning so early that it would set the tone of the day to #winning, was unheard of andwe.lapped.it.up.Like with most things built with the wrong intention, we\u2019d soon uncover their flaws. It seemed after a few short years, most of the conversation around Groupon and deals sites like them were mostly just bad reviews. Consumers were upset by the poor quality of the deals they redeemed and especially the terrible service they\u2019d receive once staff got wind and a deal was presented. Consumers were often horrified by the expectation vs. reality when they were shown to the pokiest room in the hotel, different to the luxury suite they were sold online.Side note:Their merchants sucked too (sometimes), my mom and I once bought very overpriced \u201cMandela Coins\u201d (whatever that means) that were sold and apparently held similar value to that of a Kruger rand (even though not gold) and a promise that one day they would be a great investment (we may just have been too gullible). A few years after Groupon shutdown in South Africa, I re-investigated the transaction which I never truly was comfortable with. The merchant was made up, a fake and they had a few micro sites spewing false information about the businesses legitimacy. The contact details were no longer working and Groupon had nothing to say for it. If you\u2019re reading this and you bought coins too, sorry mate, we messed up!When these were first on sale they were up to R3600 per coin \ud83d\ude12\u201cGroupon has come under harsh criticism on consumer champion website HelloPeter in the last 12 months. Out of 3,784 reports on the site about Groupon SA, 3,300 have been negative with complaints ranging from goods not being received, no refunds, to incorrect product delivery, and poor after-sales service. \u201cThe above is an extract fromhttps://businesstech.co.za/news/internet/38521/we-messed-up-groupon-sa-ceo/27 May 2013.How the Groupon model workedRestaurant exampleGroupon would approach a restaurant, asking them to reduce their prices of a few menu items, and they would create deals which would be broadcasted for a period, by email to hundreds of thousands of South Africans nationwide. The idea is that through discovery they would create a new stream of brand loyal customers, and Groupon would win by taking a commission and the merchant would win, because hey, who doesn\u2019t need a whole new stream of hungry (for whatever you\u2019ve got) customers?How did they get paidSo if you owned a burger joint and were happy to offer up your best burger as a deal, it could look something like this:Normal price: R90Groupon suggested price: R45Groupon commission: 75% (R33,75) paid when the customer buys the dealYour payout: 25% (R11,25) when the customer redeems the dealNo merchant would be excited about these numbers, but the promise of \u201ca new stream of brand loyal customers\u201d was more than enough to convince them it was a great idea!Image from randolf.jorberg.comThe customer journeyThere was nothing more irritating than being woken up by my vibrating phone every morning at 5am or earlier to get an email from a deal site. Even though I was initially excited by the idea of deals directly in my inbox, it soon got old. Deals like \u201cHuggies nappies 2 for 1\u201d or a breast pump specifically designed for me, was not my idea of the perfect morning deal.Deals most of the time, were irrelevant!Fulfilment was never a smooth or comfortable process. There was a stigma attached with pulling the crumpled or folded deal o (why are we still printing things?) from under the table - you\u2019d be seen as a cheapo! This not because its how you normally felt redeeming something you already purchased at a better price, no, the staff made you feel cheap with dirty looks and sighs which indicated they knew they may no get a tip at the end of this and therefore we very uninterested.The experience was shocking.Story after story poured in, peoples expectation always trumping the reality. Meals were differently prepared to the normal ones on the menu, soda from the fountain instead from a can, seafood platters for one sold as for two. Sometimes rooms would be as promised, but you\u2019d have to wait two hours after original check-in because it wouldn\u2019t be ready when you arrived.The level of service plummeted.Because of these bad experiences, added to that the promise of a new shiny deal in your inbox the very next day, customers were nowhere close to being loyal - on to the next!It was bad business!Enter Do A Deali\u2026Do A Deali - Part 2 (the solution) coming soonTags:business,startup,app",

Consumers were upset by the poor quality of the deals they redeemed and especially the terrible service they\u2019d receive once staff got wind and a deal was presented. Consumers were often horrified by the expectation vs. reality when they were shown to the pokiest room in the hotel, different to the luxury suite they were sold online.\u00a0<br/></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Side note:</strong> Their merchants sucked too (sometimes), my mom and I once bought very overpriced \u201cMandela Coins\u201d (whatever that means) that were sold and apparently held similar value to that of a Kruger rand (even though not gold) and a promise that one day they would be a great investment (we may just have been too gullible). A few years after Groupon shutdown in South Africa, I re-investigated the transaction which I never truly was comfortable with. The merchant was made up, a fake and they had a few micro sites spewing false information about the businesses legitimacy. The contact details were no longer working and Groupon had nothing to say for it. If you\u2019re reading this and you bought coins too, sorry mate, we messed up!</p>\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1562617356180_49135\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-below design-layout-inline combination-animation-none individual-animation-none individual-text-animation-none\" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"sqs-block-image-figure intrinsic\" style=\"max-width:1444px;\">\n<div class=\"image-block-wrapper\" data-animation-role=\"image\">\n<div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element has-aspect-ratio\" style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                \n                  padding-bottom:51.592796325683594%;\n                \n                overflow: hidden;-webkit-mask-image: -webkit-radial-gradient(white, black);\n              \">\n<img alt=\"\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins\" data-image-dimensions=\"1444x745\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-loader=\"sqs\" data-src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins\" data-stretch=\"false\" decoding=\"async\" elementtiming=\"system-image-block\" height=\"745\" loading=\"lazy\" onload='this.classList.add(\"loaded\")' sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 100vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=2500w 2500w\" style=\"display:block;object-fit: cover; width: 100%; height: 100%; object-position: 50% 50%\" width=\"1444\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"image-caption\"><p class=\"\">When these were first on sale they were up to R3600 per coin \ud83d\ude12</p></div>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1562617356180_49412\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br/></p><blockquote><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\u201cGroupon has come under harsh criticism on consumer champion website HelloPeter in the last 12 months.

This would have given me a glimpse into the reality that is the workplace environment that people don't know until they know! (I feel like that's where mid-life crises come from)13 years ago I created a platform called My Start in Life, that would aim to Inspire | Motivate | Educate high schoolers on what life after school was like.Inspiration:Success stories from people that had \"made it\" in their respective field (plumber, botanist, the pool guy - his an entrepreneur but no-one highlights that);...Motivation:Give them something to look forward too, something to push themselves for.Insight into a day in the life of {allCareers} after taking them through simple tests that gauge their interests, strengths and weaknesses (these change of course, but think: starting point) and then guide them through a personalised journey of discovery;Why, what, where and if to study (in that order);...Education:\"A base layer\"Teach them all about financial education in ways that would interest them, like \"How to save for that pair of sneakers you want to buy\";How and why to set goals;How to stay mentally and physically fit;Mentorship programmes and where to find them;...I was so passionate about this platform I had envisioned and tried to put together many many times, but I found the task a tedious one - too big for one young guy (or two at times)!For the next few years, I\u2019d be riddled with sleepless nights (seriously, for long periods of time), lots of learning by trial and error, lots of exposing myself to people that were decades my senior, in the hopes someone would latch on and just take this burden from me.Long story short:Had hundreds of conversations about this platform/attitude/way of life;Convinced many people;Nearly got funded twice;Learned all the skills I have now, that were needed to get me going then;Became a Product of my platform;Can it be replicated?MaybeI still feel it's super relevant, and I\u2019d love to do something about it.I told my friends 3 years out of school, that if I was still talking about this in the next 3 years that they should stop being friends with me - they stuck around, but its been many years on\u2026still talking about it \ud83d\ude43Nic Haralambouswhen I saw your post about the young dude that created a co-working environment with simple materials so his peers could have access to the internet I was very excited!One of the biggest threats to my platform back then, was that it was not only for schools or kids that had access to the internet, but it would be for everyone (in hindsight, that's probably too large of a segment) and not everyone had access to the internet, especially in impoverished areas.I believed though, that I needn\u2019t solve all of my problems alone, but that once kids were Inspired, Motivated, Educated - I could leave it up to them to realise their entrepreneurial brilliance and someone, somewhere would eventually do what that young man has just done - they\u2019d do the thing!To conclude:I wish I was told that I could do and be ANYTHING, and then shown what ANYTHING looked like.\ud83d\ude0a\u2014\u2014\u2014Thanks for readingBe kind.

          "text": "Learn more by reading more job specificationsMarch 30, 2021Job specs, much like coriander are things (for lack of a better word) we either love, or we hate.I hate cooking - MackayWe love when it speaks to our exact set of skills. We love when it calls for us to do things we've done hundreds of times before - \"done it before, will do it again\" or \"I can do that with my eyes closed\". We get excited when the cherry on top of it all, is a bunch of perks that we've always wished we might have, if we get the job!In another comparison (because why not), much like horoscopes, job specs are sometimes quite generic, and at times when they just seems to line up exactly how we want it to, and to keep with the analogy - \"the stars align\".Note: I do acknowledge that these specs are often just conversation starters.In reality though, all specs were not made equal and in fact, some are very badly written. More often it does not fully describe what you'll actually be doing, because let's face it, as a UXer and not dissimilar with any design discipline that involves figuring things out, you'll be tasked to do just that - \"figure things out\".Let's talk about when we hate job specsThe obvious one is - we hate job specs that ask way too much of us, those that describe four job roles in one, are spread over three A4 digital pieces of paper. We also hate job specs when they challenge us; when it challenges what we know. We go on the defence, we quickly lose our enthusiasm, and it often triggers a visceral effect - almost inciting nerves causing rosy cheeks for some and general heat under the collar (overboard-ly expressive I know, but you get my drift) for others.We also hate job specs when it challenges us; when it challenges what we knowThis is a normal human reaction, to something that challenges us. We make excuses for why where we are right now is exactly where we need to be and we might even just go quiet on the person that sent us the spec because silence is better than acknowledging defeat, right?Why not accept the challenge as an opportunity to level up?At the point of reading the spec, there is no commitment from either side, neither yours nor the recruiter/talent scout - or whatever fancy name is being used in 2021 to describe the person trying to place you.All in the name of being overly dramatic, watch Will Smith explain why you cannot be afraid of jumping out of a plane if you've not yet jumped out of a plane.Watch that >Good job specs are the perfect opportunity for you to find out what the industry is looking for. A well-crafted job spec, if nothing else provides you, at no charge,  with the structure (thank you Company-X) for a course you can follow to mould yourself into a more challenge-accepting-designer.Break down the spec into a few sections:What is the industry?How long has it/have they (company and industry) been around?What problems are they solving?How do they solve problems?What skills do they have?Which skills are they hiring?As it has got to be a mutual exchange, what do they offer in return for these skills?Read 10 specs, then read 10 more and before you know it, not only will this have given you the best understanding of what's out there for the next time you need a refresher but you\u2019ll more easily be able to \u201cread\u201d the company you are applying to, in order to understand them better. Now knowing what you like and dislike, you'll also be better equipped to make the right decisions when it\u2019s time for you to make your move - but most importantly, for every spec you've read that left you feeling inadequate and challenged, you'll have another opportunity to hone in on what you don't know, and level the bleep (bleep) up!Thanks for readingBe kind. Be helpful. Be usefulp.s. I am trying something new. I'm trying my hand at shorter pieces and hoping they make as much sense as I think my longer-form posts do.

We also hate job specs when they challenge us; when it challenges what we know. We go on the defence, we quickly lose our enthusiasm, and it often triggers a visceral effect - almost inciting nerves causing rosy cheeks for some and general heat under the collar (overboard-ly expressive I know, but you get my drift) for others.<br/></p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p><blockquote><h1 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We also hate job specs when it challenges us; when it challenges what we know </h1></blockquote><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br/>This is a normal human reaction, to something that challenges us. We make excuses for why where we are right now is exactly where we need to be and we might even just go quiet on the person that sent us the spec because silence is better than acknowledging defeat, right?<br/></p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Why not accept the challenge as an opportunity to level up?</h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br/>At the point of reading the spec, there is no commitment from either side, neither yours nor the recruiter/talent scout - or whatever fancy name is being used in 2021 to describe the person trying to place you.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em><br/>All in the name of being overly dramatic, watch Will Smith explain why you cannot be afraid of jumping out of a plane if you've not yet jumped out of a plane. </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG-F_rRVdLc\">Watch that &gt;</a><br/></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Good job specs are the perfect opportunity for you to find out what the industry is looking for. A well-crafted job spec, if nothing else provides you, at no charge,  with the structure (<em>thank you Company-X</em>) for a course you can follow to mould yourself into a more challenge-accepting-designer.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br/></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Break down the spec into a few sections:</p><ol data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What is the industry?</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">How long has it/have they (company and industry) been around?</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What problems are they solving?</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">How do they solve problems?</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What skills do they have?</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Which skills are they hiring?</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As it has got to be a mutual exchange, what do they offer in return for these skills?<br/><br/></p></li></ol><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Read 10 specs, then read 10 more and before you know it, not only will this have given you the best understanding of what's out there for the next time you need a refresher but you\u2019ll more easily be able to \u201cread\u201d the company you are applying to, in order to understand them better. Now knowing what you like and dislike, you'll also be better equipped to make the right decisions when it\u2019s time for you to make your move - but most importantly, for every spec you've read that left you feeling inadequate and challenged, you'll have another opportunity to hone in on what you don't know, and level the bleep (bleep) up!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br/><br/>Thanks for reading</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Be kind. Be helpful. Be useful<br/></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">p.s. I am trying something new.

          "text": "A Story of the State of Business in 2021!May 17, 2021It\u2019s 2021, and my mate speaks for weeks about a pair of shoes he really really wants/needs. Full disclosure up front: My friend runs more kilometers per week than I put on my car and more than most people run per year (more on that later) so, he is a serious runner.Serious runners need serious shoes. He told me he found the pair he wanted, online but he really wanted to try them on first - the old try before you buy.The shoes he wants are Nikes, so, excited one early morning he heads to the Nike store at the Waterfront. Upon entering he\u2019s greeted by a masked figure holding out a spray bottle of sanitizer (the norm at this point). After the formalities were over, knowing exactly what he was looking for, he asked the figure (let\u2019s call her Amy) if they had the shoes in stock, and in his size. He, excited as can be was met with a\u201cwe don\u2019t have your size\u201d. At that point, he enquires whether or not any of the other branches might have his size. His question this time met with an\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but Canal Walk might have because they are a bigger store\u201d.Right now Amy\u2019s got a choice to make, she can 1) Make zero effort to push a sale through her books, or 2) Make this happen.Side note: I feel it take more to provide a shitty experience vs, doing just a few things right to make for a good one.He prompts her to call Canal Walk to enquire, Amy obliges and he\u2019s told that they do have his size but not having a car makes this a mission impossible.Remember the instant gratification scale is tipping slowly in the opposite direction, and that\u2019s basically the one true thing fuelling everything we do these days.Another Side note: I am well aware that the store not having stock of this shoe in his size is not directly Amy\u2019s fault, but if you think hard and long, somewhere, somehow she and every other staff member working in or behind the scenes of that store - they\u2019ve got a part to play.They\u2019re just about to lose a sale when he enquires about whether there was another shoe that could compare or match up to the one he came in for. This of course a tricky question for most (or at least we\u2019ve gotten used to this outcome), but surely in a Nike store, staff would be trained on, well Nike products?!No inquiry into why he was going for a trail shoe in the first place when in reality (and only he knows this) he does 90% of his running on the road. She had no knowledge of a pair of shoes that could create a similar or better experience, even if they were more expensive.Defeated, he leaves.We can\u2019t continue the narrative that all businesses are suffering right now, it\u2019s 2021 - you\u2019re going to have to do one better than what everyone else is doing. As individuals, you\u2019re going to have to learn more about what you\u2019re doing, selling, promoting so that in store, outside or wherever you are, you are domain expert so when people \u201cstep into your office\u201d - they know and you know \u201cYou got this!\u201dThat - knowing enough (or everything) about what you\u2019re doing, selling, promoting is the first step in creating/crafting a memorable experience.My friend turned toSuperbalistto buy his shoes.Benefits:It was cheaper!!!They had his size and preferred colorwayHe was able to pay it off (why not) using PayFlex (that review coming soon\u2026)Zero barrier to entry bringing the sunshine, on a Tuesday that started off slightly gloomier.Drawbacks:No instant gratification (he still has to wait a day for the shoes)For just anybody (a new or casual runner) this might have been ok. But for an enthusiast (think, enthusiast of anything) someone that wakes up knowing the only way - is out, outside, come rain or shine, this won\u2019t do!It\u2019s 2021Years before one might have gotten away with \u201che is a minority\u201d. In this context and without knowing the real numbers, take me with a brick of salt here, but I don\u2019t think this is the case any longer.It\u2019s 2021, mate - why shouldn\u2019t he have his cake and eat it too?Why was the experience inside the Nike store, worse than the wonderful buy now, pay later experience he had online with Superbalist? Yes, they\u2019ve got a dope team, dedicated to creating experiences that are more than memorable that they want you to speak about, and I am. Why did the brand, that bascially paved the way for other companies (related and not) through amazing products and product experiences - why did they fail in comparison this time?Bad business (will leave this here)\u2026by Fonda",

It\u2019s a well-crafted, well thought out, personalized offer that entices you to find out more - so you do.After a few messages are shared, the Recruiter tells you there\u2019s an opportunity to earn X - which is your current salary plus 35%.This is what happens in your brain:You get excited at the prospects of earning more money; thenYou start spending that money in your head;You start justifying why you need the extra money;You start comparing your current salary to your potential new one;You start feeling like you\u2019re just not earning enough; andYou start to wonder if coffee runs and cool people are everything;Your newfound motivation - a currency, which you\u2019ll also use to get yourself those new wheels you\u2019ve been dreaming of (or have you just now created this dream?).Now, with clouded judgment (let\u2019s speed this along), out with the old as you start your first day at your new place of work.You are so excited about the parking bay you were given, the massive bowl of bananas you now have access to at no cost, and all the other shiny things in the office (people, things, feelings).Fast forward three months\u2014You\u2019re just about flowing with your current team, your line manager isn\u2019t as sharp as he/she was in the interview, but it\u2019s not that bad. The early morning drive into the office, although only twice a week is a bit tedious and the view from the window next to your desk - average, but the grunt of your new GTi makes up for it all.It\u2019s the start of the fourth month and while at the office your phone lights up -NOTIFICATION, notification, NOTIFICATION!All your monthly debits go off and you\u2019re baffled because you realize that you\u2019ve now actually got less money than you usually had before, around the same time of the month.Puzzled, you check your bank account and the numbers just don\u2019t make sense.Let\u2019s examine what happened:You got more money, therefore you were taxed more. The new parking bay you received also came as part of your CTC (cost-to-company), and the fancy car you park in that bay too. You bought some new gear for your first day, (maybe you didn\u2019t need that new laptop bag with the built-in charger).\u00a0At home, you added a few subscriptions, got a faster internet line, and took out a gym contract so your mom could join your sister for spin class on Tuesdays and Thursdays - sweet.As your income increased, so did your expenses.You\u2019re back to square one, yet now you don\u2019t have your old but awesome colleagues: because your commute is a bit further you\u2019ve lost some of your routines, and although your new desk setup at home is sleek, you recognize that the Slack group labeled \u201cgeneral\u201d is just not as fun as it used to be.You\u2019ve lost your motivation (a currency) and you\u2019ve lost your motivation.If you\u2019re here but still don\u2019t get it,extrinsic motivationrefers to behaviors that are influenced by external rewards (praise, fame or money).These rewards will come and go and are influenced by a number of factors, often out of our control and therefore we face being left worse off than when we started.The goal:find something that gets you sprung out of bed in the morning, find the thing that puts a pep in your step, do that thing that lights the fire within you (and now that all the metaphors are out the way), do something that helps someone else achieve their dreams, etc.Along the way, you\u2019ll have discovered what intrinsically (solely for personal enjoyment or personal satisfaction) motivates you - try it, you might just love it.Thanks for readingBe kind.
