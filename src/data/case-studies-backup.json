        "text": "How we broke an e-commerce giant!April 29, 2019We took a price aggregator with an awesome built in product and price comparison tool, made it responsive (the task) but at the same time stripped it of everything engaging. I\u2019ll tell you how and what happened next.We were a UX team of 10 - made up of Interaction Designers (I was one), front-end developers, a UX researcher, 2 BA\u2019s, our UX team lead (also head of product) and we even had a product advisor! We were also backed by a big squad of back end devs, a R&D team constantly working on improving search and 30 other people doing all sorts.Why did I take the time to introduce you to the team? Because it\u2019s important you know how many people were impacted by our bad UX decisions.To make sure no-one is hurt or takes complete offence by anything that is said here, even though I believe this is the truest account of what happened - I will call the companyE-comRetailer XLets start here, what wasE-com Retailer X?E-com Retailer Xwas once a leading South African price aggregator and at the time had such an impressive SEO footprint that you could just about search for any product for sale online on any of the most popular search engines and you\u2019d findE-com Retailer Xlisting of that product in the top 3 results. This site used to PUMP!This is almost exactly whatE-com Retailer Xlooked like when I joined:\u00a0This is Takealot.com - South Africas no.1 online superstore!View fullsizeTakealot.com - South Africas no.1 online superstoreThings they got right:Exposed categories with nested sub-cats;Prominent search;Highlighted Daily Deals which get sent to account holders inboxes daily (great deals here guys!);Brand search;Tabs, all in all not hiding much behind navigation;Ad space used to highlight new products, sales and seasonal best buys;Tiles displaying popular products/sections of the day, week or month, I think this is randomised (even better!);The use of a few UI tricks like whitespace, moving products on a carousel and large open sub categories make it really easy to navigate around this page.I cant be 100% certain of everything, but I do rememberE-com Retailer Xlooking almost exactly like this when I started. So if it works now, why did it not work then? We\u2019re all aware that trends, usage patterns and people especially change overtime. But I\u2019ll explain why I think us changing from this simple, effective UX was the beginning of the end for this online giant.OK, so the site had an amazing SEO footprint - Cool story bro, what was so special about thisE-com Retailer X?Let\u2019s diveLet\u2019s look at the 4 different models for e-commerce retailers:Free advertising (paid for ad ons) |gumtree.co.zaSell their own products and handle fulfilment |takealot.comSell other peoples things and take a cut when user buys (they handle fulfilment) |bidorbuy.co.zaAggregate products from all suppliers and link users to the suppliers sites for purchase and fulfilment |E-com Retailer XBesides amazing SEO bringing organic traffic to a site that could show aggregated products, ranges of models and colours, then differentiating then finally by price, there was another trick up their online sleeve.Price ComparisonYou could look at up to 3 products side-by-side and compare them across a range of criteria. Ever seen GSMArena?Like this\ufeffWhy am I writing this case study and why am I so passionate about it?Firstly, I am passionate about everything I write/speak about. But, I also really believed in the product, the product vision and loved the working environment and admired my colleagues.How the perfect eco-system workedUsers would search the internet for a product they wanted to purchase - let\u2019s say they wanted an iPhone XS. They would open a browser and on their fav search engine run a search for\u00a0 \u201ciPhone XS for sale Cape Town\u201d.9 out of 10 timesE-com Retailer Xwould come up as a paid search and then also the top 3 results for this search.A user could click on the link and be taken to the product page where they would be able to discover much more about the iPhone XS.Detailed descriptions and more info:Color (Black, White, Rose gold)Capacity (64, 128, 256GB)What\u2019s in the boxDifferent angles if you hadn\u2019t seen it beforeWatch an expert review the productRead user reviews from people who have recently purchased itCompare it side-by-side to the iPhone XS Max and the Samsung Galaxy S10Find the online supplier with the best priceOnce our common user had spent enough time browsing around on the site they\u2019d finally choose their preferred price and supplier and then, knowing enough about the product, complete the purchase on the supplier\u2019s side.Every time a user clicked through fromE-com Retailer Xto the suppliers online store, that supplier would payE-com Retailer Xa click through fee. And that is how we made the big bucks!Most importantThe most important pieces of the puzzle that created the ecosystem and kept it working, were:Great SEO effortsGreat email and online marketing effortsGreat support teamAccessibility across almost any cellphone from the dumbest to the smartest and everything in between (Remember Blackberrys)Cross platform integrations (WeChat, SMS, MTN)Very stable product with solid dev team backing itThe TaskMakeE-com Retailer XresponsiveReachAt that time we had people using SMS to search for products, and using 3rd party chat platforms, users could run a search and in almost chat-bot like style receive results and click out to complete discovery. We had deals with major network service providers preloading the app on flagship devices in and outside of South Africa.ProblemOur reach was far and our team was big, but having a range of different applications across multiple stores with multiple code bases became a nightmare to manage and even scarier to test (I was testing on 24 devices at one point). \u00a0In order to keep ahead of the times, it was decided that ONE RESPONSIVE SITE TO RULE THEM ALL was the answer.Over the period of a year, we madeE-com Retailer Xresponsive. Through a combined team effort - which included late night work sessions multiple times per week, sprints of varying lengths and feedback rich retrospectives lead, attended and facilitated by our expert team. But, never without the energy shifting interruption of miss management, lack of communication, bad planning and no understanding of who we built it for - we did it!View fullsizeOld screenshot of a mockup created at the timeWhere we went wrongWe focused solely on the new product we were building and barely took into account flows that were already working for users, and oh, making money for us;We laughed at the SEO guy when he tried tosqueezein a ticket or two for the dev team to ensure the new platform was as SEO\u2019d (sorry) as the current one was;We lost sight of the core and built new features to bring extra revenue streams that were so far off the business model that it sometimes seemed we were trying to makemoney for jam.We did not understand enough about our users and how they used our site and what kept them coming back;We flipped the switch on old users with no real instruction or guidance on how to use this newly launched platform (Beta may as well have been Alpha);We stripped all the information scent from the product and now pushed up above the fold a new untested feature we believed was ground breaking, that we would later find out was nothing at all;We focused our time and energy on making it as lean as possible with some flows feeling almost useless;We tampered with the only real sticky part of the site, (product discovery), and in doing so weremovedeverything that would keep users engaged.Removing every-engaging-thingExposed categories -information scent;Trending products -social validation, group identity;Side-by-side comparison -autonomy, trust, choice;Multiple images and colours -trust;Ability to zoom -trust;User reviews -group identity, social validation;Expert reviews -trust;Video product review -trust, dopamine;Deep descriptions -trust, progressive disclosure;Ratings -social validation;Too much whitespace (almost empty) -trust;The product broke the businessIt was more important that the CTA beredderandBIGGERso that users would get through the experience in record time to click it. This lightening fast transaction was great for the numbers, we increased our clicks to suppliers websites 5 fold but massively decreased conversion on their end. Users were no longer discovering the products they wanted to buy onE-com Retailer X. They could now only check the price, and then would have to click and view multiple suppliers online stores to get the overall idea of the product. It wasn\u2019t long before suppliers could smell a rat and when our monthly revenues became so high, (them spending money) and conversions month-on-month plummeted for them, we had messed with the most important part of the business - the model!This time, the product failed us. One of the biggest suppliers at the time, cancelled their contract and withdraw a few hundred-thousand product matches.That was one of the best working experiences of my life so far. The team, the vibe, the commitment to build something amazing under immense amounts of pressure and the resilience to stick it out as a team even when we fought management on ideas - which posed threats - the feeling of progress and success remained. Getting lunch with my friends or playing ping pong against temporary foes - this was a great group of people who all just so happened to work under the same roof, toward the same goal. To them I will be forever grateful, for even though we failed, we failed together and we learned much more through that experience than any textbook could teach.Closing notesTwo months after I resigned and left the company, around 20 people/friends were retrenched and asked to leave at a minute\u2019s notice.- Theteambroke the product;- Theproductbroke the business;- Thebusinessbroke the team.The company, since then, seems to be doing much better and I wish them nothing but success as they continue their journey.Thanks for readingBe kind.

This lightening fast transaction was great for the numbers, we increased our clicks to suppliers websites 5 fold but massively decreased conversion on their end. Users were no longer discovering the products they wanted to buy on <strong>E-com Retailer X</strong>. They could now only check the price, and then would have to click and view multiple suppliers online stores to get the overall idea of the product. It wasn\u2019t long before suppliers could smell a rat and when our monthly revenues became so high, (them spending money) and conversions month-on-month plummeted for them, we had messed with the most important part of the business - the model!\u00a0</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This time, the product failed us.

Getting lunch with my friends or playing ping pong against temporary foes - this was a great group of people who all just so happened to work under the same roof, toward the same goal.

And for the customers well, we\u2019d give them deals they actually wanted, when they wanted it, wherever they were.Highlights:We spoke to 30 plus of Groupons subscribers (mostly family and friends, and a couple of strangers)I spoke to the man who brought Groupon to South Africa, Neal GandhiWe raised the startup capital ourselves with loans from family and friendsWe designed and developed a Blackberry App in 2011We partnered with a business advisor from the UKOver Skype we pitched a Lord from Scotland for fundingWe spoke to some of the top minds in marketing and business strategy from well-known and respected advertising agencies locally and abroadWe took to the streets to test the our MVP with merchantsStanding in front of potential business people with an iPad and a 1min 30second video (awkward)We nearly got investmentWe spent money too early as we dreamed of making so much moreThe market wasn\u2019t ready for a location based deal finding app thenWe builta location based, deal finding smartphone application- this is mouthful and always needs to be elaborated. We did try making it easier to digest, and while there wasn\u2019t anything exactly like it in the market to compare it to, we would sometimes just go with \u201cA better version of Groupon\u201d.Let\u2019s break it down:Location based- Wherever you areDeal finding- It looks for deals, based on your interest (which you\u2019ve specified)Smartphone application- In 2011 we needed to mention thisIn 2011 Blackberry was still very much a thing, so we chose to build the app for the Blackberry App Store first. We enlisted the help of a development team from India, the same team we used for bigger projects at Scream Media.We wanted to hitcmd+r(refresh) on this cesspool the deal buying economy had created - \u201cGood, clean business\u201d is what we coined it as.Merchants could offer deals they were comfortable offering, starting at 25% off (as a minimum, because is it a deal otherwise?) and they could even offer current specials like Calcacchios Twos\u2019day special where you buy one, get one. They would have full control of the deals they posted, the margins they set and the validity of these deals.For users of the app they could select the types of deals they were interested in and opt-in to receive push notifications in time to receive these deals.Example:Candy could be driving home through the CBD after a long day at the office, when suddenly her phone pings her \u201cPiiingggg!\u201d and a push notification shows that if she heads to La Perla right now, she can enjoy a free pink drink and with her feet dipped into the little pool she can enjoy the beautiful Cape Town sunset.And just as easy as it would be for the merchant to create the deal and push it live, it would be as easy for the customer to redeem the deal. All they\u2019d need to do was show the deal on their smartphone to the waitress of the restaurant, the therapist at the spa or receptionist at the hotel.How did we plan to keep track of how many deals were redeemed from the app?Well, can a restaurant keep track of how many of its customers saw their ad on a billboard along the high way?Nope.Reminder of the Groupon model:Continuing with the Candy\u2019s example, Pink DrinkNormal price: R86Groupon suggested price: R43Groupon commission: 75% (R32,25) paid when Candy buys the dealYour payout: 25% (R10,75) when Candy redeems the dealBecause the above would no longer be the case, they could afford to have every person in the restaurant use the deal and still have it be profitable for them.They would keep the same level of service offered on Twosdays at Calcacchio and the customers\u00a0would be as happy as Larry. Would it create a new stream of brand loyal customers? Maybe - maybe not, but the rest of the work would be up to them and, for a flat monthly fee, we would provide the platform for them to make it happen.Neal Gandhi said\u201cIt\u2019s a better business, but Groupon will make more money\u201d. This was in response to us pitching him, to get a feel for where we fit into this industry.Side note:We did implement a QR code for the customers, that was scannable by the merchant from inside the app. We even created a prototype for a way-to-pay that would allow customers to scan a merchants QR code to pay for their deal with a wallet on their phones. This was 2 years beforeScapScanwould launch in 2013 as a fully-fledged QR code powered payment system. Nicely done!Via LinkedIn we somehow managed to hook up with an early stage startup advisor from the UK, who did his best to help us sharpen our pitch and who even toyed with the idea of putting some of his own money into this.Which came first, the chicken or the egg?We needed users to get merchants on board, but we also needed merchants to get the users interested.We ran competitions on our Facebook page, where we would offer cash vouchers (of the type of merchants we hoped to attract) to potential customers. All this to start building an audience.We took to the streets, with a team primarily made up of students, wearing Do-A-Deali branded t-shirts and a few with iPads (armed with our kickass explainer video) to validate our business.Through pure luck, we managed to get a meeting with Michael Abel and Zeyaad Davids (now head of marketing for Virgin Active South Africa) of M&C Saatchi Abel. In doing my due diligence I found an article Michael wrote on challenger brands.\u201cA Challenger Brand as I apply the term, and having studiously avoided looking for formal definitions, is a brand or business that wishes to aggressively occupy the territory or market currently held by established others, usually through a differentiated offering and/or approach.\u201d- Michael AbelIn closing our first meeting I muttered \u201cAre we the Challenger Brand?\u201d, hoping to score  some brownie points for having done my research before the meeting. Michael replied\u201cNo, you\u2019re innovators\u201d. That was way more than I needed to feel like we\u2019d happened upon something really great! Time for celebratory beers! This while we started to spend (in our minds) the money we had not yet made on cars we could never afford and places we\u2019d only dream of going once the millions started to pour. Oh little light of mine\u2026One day after covering most of Long Street\u2019s businesses,we reached the following consensus:We would need to get users onto the platform to draw the merchants in. I was fortunate enough to sit with the owner of an already popular bar & restaurant in an always busy section of Long Street. During our chat he outlined what it really cost their business to be on platforms like Groupon, and that even though most times the margins they made were lower and the customers were not always repeat ones, they did still bring in a lot of foot traffic. But, and he said this would probably be true for many other businesses on the strip, if we had a bunch of users on the platform to start, there would be no reason for them not to run a trial with us.We packed up the team and went back to our home office to share notes.Do A Deali - Part 3 (the conclusion) coming soonTags:business,startup,app",

About 6 months in my boss and I thought of a great idea and before we knew it our relationship changed from employee - employer, to business partners.Ok that sounds like we did it in an afternoon, it took a smidge longer than that, but it really was quick and that was the beginning of a new journey for both of us, together and as individuals.Completely unrelated to the company I was working for, and he was running, we spent loads of time with our heads in the clouds. We dreamed of solutions to problems using technology we interacted with on a daily basis. Most of the time we\u2019d do this after we\u2019d had a few beers and at the end laugh it off or put it in the ice-box (I wonder how many ideas are in this ice-box everyone puts things into). This time however, we felt like we landed on something worthy of pursuing and before we knew it, we were building a business.At the time in South Africa, Groupon was the best thing since sliced bread. This was mostly because of their marketing of unbelievable deals that any sane person could not pass on. Having deals sent directly to your inbox every morning so early that it would set the tone of the day to #winning, was unheard of andwe.lapped.it.up.Like with most things built with the wrong intention, we\u2019d soon uncover their flaws. It seemed after a few short years, most of the conversation around Groupon and deals sites like them were mostly just bad reviews. Consumers were upset by the poor quality of the deals they redeemed and especially the terrible service they\u2019d receive once staff got wind and a deal was presented. Consumers were often horrified by the expectation vs. reality when they were shown to the pokiest room in the hotel, different to the luxury suite they were sold online.Side note:Their merchants sucked too (sometimes), my mom and I once bought very overpriced \u201cMandela Coins\u201d (whatever that means) that were sold and apparently held similar value to that of a Kruger rand (even though not gold) and a promise that one day they would be a great investment (we may just have been too gullible). A few years after Groupon shutdown in South Africa, I re-investigated the transaction which I never truly was comfortable with. The merchant was made up, a fake and they had a few micro sites spewing false information about the businesses legitimacy. The contact details were no longer working and Groupon had nothing to say for it. If you\u2019re reading this and you bought coins too, sorry mate, we messed up!When these were first on sale they were up to R3600 per coin \ud83d\ude12\u201cGroupon has come under harsh criticism on consumer champion website HelloPeter in the last 12 months. Out of 3,784 reports on the site about Groupon SA, 3,300 have been negative with complaints ranging from goods not being received, no refunds, to incorrect product delivery, and poor after-sales service. \u201cThe above is an extract fromhttps://businesstech.co.za/news/internet/38521/we-messed-up-groupon-sa-ceo/27 May 2013.How the Groupon model workedRestaurant exampleGroupon would approach a restaurant, asking them to reduce their prices of a few menu items, and they would create deals which would be broadcasted for a period, by email to hundreds of thousands of South Africans nationwide. The idea is that through discovery they would create a new stream of brand loyal customers, and Groupon would win by taking a commission and the merchant would win, because hey, who doesn\u2019t need a whole new stream of hungry (for whatever you\u2019ve got) customers?How did they get paidSo if you owned a burger joint and were happy to offer up your best burger as a deal, it could look something like this:Normal price: R90Groupon suggested price: R45Groupon commission: 75% (R33,75) paid when the customer buys the dealYour payout: 25% (R11,25) when the customer redeems the dealNo merchant would be excited about these numbers, but the promise of \u201ca new stream of brand loyal customers\u201d was more than enough to convince them it was a great idea!Image from randolf.jorberg.comThe customer journeyThere was nothing more irritating than being woken up by my vibrating phone every morning at 5am or earlier to get an email from a deal site. Even though I was initially excited by the idea of deals directly in my inbox, it soon got old. Deals like \u201cHuggies nappies 2 for 1\u201d or a breast pump specifically designed for me, was not my idea of the perfect morning deal.Deals most of the time, were irrelevant!Fulfilment was never a smooth or comfortable process. There was a stigma attached with pulling the crumpled or folded deal o (why are we still printing things?) from under the table - you\u2019d be seen as a cheapo! This not because its how you normally felt redeeming something you already purchased at a better price, no, the staff made you feel cheap with dirty looks and sighs which indicated they knew they may no get a tip at the end of this and therefore we very uninterested.The experience was shocking.Story after story poured in, peoples expectation always trumping the reality. Meals were differently prepared to the normal ones on the menu, soda from the fountain instead from a can, seafood platters for one sold as for two. Sometimes rooms would be as promised, but you\u2019d have to wait two hours after original check-in because it wouldn\u2019t be ready when you arrived.The level of service plummeted.Because of these bad experiences, added to that the promise of a new shiny deal in your inbox the very next day, customers were nowhere close to being loyal - on to the next!It was bad business!Enter Do A Deali\u2026Do A Deali - Part 2 (the solution) coming soonTags:business,startup,app",

Consumers were often horrified by the expectation vs. reality when they were shown to the pokiest room in the hotel, different to the luxury suite they were sold online.\u00a0<br/></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Side note:</strong> Their merchants sucked too (sometimes), my mom and I once bought very overpriced \u201cMandela Coins\u201d (whatever that means) that were sold and apparently held similar value to that of a Kruger rand (even though not gold) and a promise that one day they would be a great investment (we may just have been too gullible). A few years after Groupon shutdown in South Africa, I re-investigated the transaction which I never truly was comfortable with. The merchant was made up, a fake and they had a few micro sites spewing false information about the businesses legitimacy. The contact details were no longer working and Groupon had nothing to say for it. If you\u2019re reading this and you bought coins too, sorry mate, we messed up!</p>\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1562617356180_49135\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-below design-layout-inline combination-animation-none individual-animation-none individual-text-animation-none\" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"sqs-block-image-figure intrinsic\" style=\"max-width:1444px;\">\n<div class=\"image-block-wrapper\" data-animation-role=\"image\">\n<div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element has-aspect-ratio\" style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                \n                  padding-bottom:51.592796325683594%;\n                \n                overflow: hidden;-webkit-mask-image: -webkit-radial-gradient(white, black);\n              \">\n<img alt=\"\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins\" data-image-dimensions=\"1444x745\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-loader=\"sqs\" data-src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins\" data-stretch=\"false\" decoding=\"async\" elementtiming=\"system-image-block\" height=\"745\" loading=\"lazy\" onload='this.classList.add(\"loaded\")' sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 100vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc70d81ceaeb60001c9ba94/1562618324311-ZOPXGPJ2ZTQK6BMPQO4W/groupon_mandela_coins?format=2500w 2500w\" style=\"display:block;object-fit: cover; width: 100%; height: 100%; object-position: 50% 50%\" width=\"1444\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"image-caption\"><p class=\"\">When these were first on sale they were up to R3600 per coin \ud83d\ude12</p></div>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1562617356180_49412\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br/></p><blockquote><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\u201cGroupon has come under harsh criticism on consumer champion website HelloPeter in the last 12 months.
