        "text": "We took a price aggregator with an awesome built in product and price comparison tool, made it responsive (the task) but at the same time stripped it of everything engaging. I'll tell you how and what happened next.\n\nWe were a UX team of 10 - made up of Interaction Designers (I was one), front-end developers, a UX researcher, 2 BA's, our UX team lead (also head of product) and we even had a product advisor! We were also backed by a big squad of back end devs, a R&D team constantly working on improving search and 30 other people doing all sorts.\n\nWhy did I take the time to introduce you to the team? Because it's important you know how many people were impacted by our bad UX decisions.\n\nTo make sure no-one is hurt or takes complete offence by anything that is said here, even though I believe this is the truest account of what happened - I will call the company **E-com Retailer X**"

        "text": "**E-com Retailer X** was once a leading South African price aggregator and at the time had such an impressive SEO footprint that you could just about search for any product for sale online on any of the most popular search engines and you'd find **E-com Retailer X** listing of that product in the top 3 results. This site used to PUMP!\n\nThis is almost exactly what **E-com Retailer X** looked like when I joined:\n\n**Things they got right:**\n\n• Exposed categories with nested sub-cats\n• Prominent search\n• Highlighted Daily Deals which get sent to account holders inboxes daily\n• Brand search\n• Tabs, all in all not hiding much behind navigation\n• Ad space used to highlight new products, sales and seasonal best buys\n• Tiles displaying popular products/sections of the day, week or month\n\nThe use of a few UI tricks like whitespace, moving products on a carousel and large open sub categories make it really easy to navigate around this page."

Sell their own products and handle fulfilment | takealot.com\n3. Sell other peoples things and take a cut when user buys (they handle fulfilment) | bidorbuy.co.za\n4. Aggregate products from all suppliers and link users to the suppliers sites for purchase and fulfilment | **E-com Retailer X**\n\nBesides amazing SEO bringing organic traffic to a site that could show aggregated products, ranges of models and colours, then differentiating then finally by price, there was another trick up their online sleeve.\n\n**Price Comparison**\n\nYou could look at up to 3 products side-by-side and compare them across a range of criteria. Ever seen GSMArena?"

They would open a browser and on their fav search engine run a search for \"iPhone XS for sale Cape Town\". *9 out of 10 times* **E-com Retailer X** would come up as a paid search and then also the top 3 results for this search.\n\nA user could click on the link and be taken to the product page where they would be able to discover much more about the iPhone XS.\n\n**Detailed descriptions and more info:**\n\n• Color (Black, White, Rose gold)\n• Capacity (64, 128, 256GB)\n• What's in the box\n• Different angles if you hadn't seen it before\n• Watch an expert review the product\n• Read user reviews from people who have recently purchased it\n• Compare it side-by-side to the iPhone XS Max and the Samsung Galaxy S10\n• Find the online supplier with the best price\n\nOnce our common user had spent enough time browsing around on the site they'd finally choose their preferred price and supplier and then, knowing enough about the product, complete the purchase on the supplier's side.\n\n> Every time a user clicked through from **E-com Retailer X** to the suppliers online store, that supplier would pay **E-com Retailer X** a click through fee.

In order to keep ahead of the times, it was decided that ONE RESPONSIVE SITE TO RULE THEM ALL was the answer.\n\nOver the period of a year, we made **E-com Retailer X** responsive. Through a combined team effort - which included late night work sessions multiple times per week, sprints of varying lengths and feedback rich retrospectives lead, attended and facilitated by our expert team. But, never without the energy shifting interruption of miss management, lack of communication, bad planning and no understanding of who we built it for - we did it!"

        "text": "It was more important that the CTA be **redder** and **BIGGER** so that users would get through the experience in record time to click it. This lightening fast transaction was great for the numbers, we increased our clicks to suppliers websites 5 fold but massively decreased conversion on their end. Users were no longer discovering the products they wanted to buy on **E-com Retailer X**. They could now only check the price, and then would have to click and view multiple suppliers online stores to get the overall idea of the product. It wasn't long before suppliers could smell a rat and when our monthly revenues became so high, (them spending money) and conversions month-on-month plummeted for them, we had messed with the most important part of the business - the model!\n\nThis time, the product failed us. One of the biggest suppliers at the time, cancelled their contract and withdraw a few hundred-thousand product matches.\n\nThat was one of the best working experiences of my life so far. The team, the vibe, the commitment to build something amazing under immense amounts of pressure and the resilience to stick it out as a team even when we fought management on ideas - which posed threats - the feeling of progress and success remained. Getting lunch with my friends or playing ping pong against temporary foes - this was a great group of people who all just so happened to work under the same roof, toward the same goal. To them I will be forever grateful, for even though we failed, we failed together and we learned much more through that experience than any textbook could teach."
